# TF2 Rebalanced (Alpha - Version 0.1)

TF2 rebalanced is a [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) and a [Custom Weapons 3](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=285258) server plugin designed to rebalance the game's weapons, classes, and mechanics around a competitive format. The goal of this plugin is to make most of the game's weapons competitively viable, whether that includes improving weak weapons, or nerfing strong ones that are currently banned. We also plan to make some changes to classes themselves, and add new weapons that we feel fit competitive gameplay.



## Changes (So Far):

- Scout

  - **The Shortstop**: ~~Removed the shove~~, but gave the weapon increased damage against buildings and increased healing while it's deployed. This improves it as a utility weapon, as well as helps the scout combat engineers better.
    - \+ 15% healing from all sources while active.
    - \+ 50% damage to buildings.
    - Holds a 4-shot clip and reloads its entire clip at once.

- #### Sniper

  - **The Machina:** Now has 15% slower reload speed and the charge rate is decreased by 10%.
    - \+ On Full Charge: +15% damage per shot
    - \+ On Full Charge: Projectiles penetrate players
    - \- Cannot fire unless zoomed
    - \- Fires tracer rounds 
    - \- Reload speed decreased by 15%
    - \- Charge rate decreased by 10%



## Installation & Setup

To install, first make sure you have [SouceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/index.php), [Metamod](https://www.sourcemm.net/), [tf2items](https://builds.limetech.io/?p=tf2items), [TF2Attributes](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=210221), and [Custom Weapons Beta 3](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=285258) installed on your server. Once this is done, you can either download a release, and extract the zip to your server's root, or clone the repo in the addons/sourcemod folder. If you do the latter, you will need to compile the SourcePawn scripts.

With the current version, once you've installed everything, you can use "!c" in chat to open the weapon selection menu, where you may select rebalanced or new weapons, although eventually we plan to have the rebalanced weapons replace their normal counterparts automatically.
